Skypowered App

This is the README file for the upcoming Skypowered App.

## What it does

Skypowered is a brand-new way that helps you track your solar-yield and understand its impact.

While there are hundreds of trackers for your roof-power-plant, no solutions were existing that do the same for portable solar panels.
Now, with Skypowered you can easily track what you charge with portable solar panels and get great insights.

This is done by entering the battery capacity of you devices. When you charge one of these, you simply state the percentage and Skypowered calculates the rest for you.

Please note that Skypowered only offers rough estimates and it does not replace lab measurements.

## Who made it

Hello 🙋! My name is Johann Schuster and I am 16 years old. Since my early days, I have been fascinated by technology and science. Programming has been a hobby of mine for quite a while, and in early 2026, I am fulfilling a big dream by releasing my first app on the App Store. Skypowered is the first app I built that doesn’t only help me, but hopefully also solves a small problem for you.
